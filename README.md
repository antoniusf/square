How to run the game

There are Windows and Linux executables in their respective directories. If you want to run it from source, you'll need Python 2.7 and Pygame.

How to play
-----------

Find out for yourself! You only need your mouse and the left mouse button.

Notes
-----

* To play through, roughly 1 to 2 minutes are needed. If you think such a tiny game is not worth your bandwidth, don't download it.
* The Executables have been built with pyInstaller. I hope they work!
